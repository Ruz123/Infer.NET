# Infer.NET
Infer.NET is a framework for running Bayesian inference in graphical models. It can also be used for probabilistic programming.
One can use Infer.NET to solve many different kinds of machine learning problems - from standard problems like classification, recommendation or clustering through to customised solutions to domain-specific problems.
Infer.NET has been used in a wide variety of domains including information retrieval, bioinformatics, epidemiology, vision, and many others.

There currently are four maintained Infer.NET nuget packages:

Microsoft.ML.Probabilistic contains classes and methods needed to execute the inference code.

Microsoft.ML.Probabilistic.Compiler contains the Infer.NET Compiler, which takes model descriptions written using the Infer.NET API and converts them into inference code. It also contains utilities for the visualization of the generated code.

Microsoft.ML.Probabilistic.Learners contains complete machine learning applications including a classifier and a recommender system.

Microsoft.ML.Probabilistic.Visualizers.Windows contains an alternative .NET Framework and Windows specific set of visualization tools for exploring and analyzing models.
